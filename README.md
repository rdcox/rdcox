## Greetings and salutations

A man of poor taste and internet culture:
- 🛒   I’m currently working on a team simulating robots at 6 River Systems / Shopify
- 🧠   I’m currently learning about React, Node.js, Cypress, ROS, game theory
- 👾   I enjoy long runs, 4x games, MTG, reading Wikipedia, and music that sounds like nothing
