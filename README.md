## Greetings and salutations!

I like to build cool things that answer interesting questions.

Excuse the empty space, I recently restarted this account to clean out the code I wasn't proud of. It'll be filling up again soon.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [University of Helsinki: Fullstack Open Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about React, MongoDB, GraphQL
- 🤡 I enjoy running, exploring interesting datasets, and reading about internet culture
