## Greetings and salutations

- ðŸ›’   Iâ€™m currently ~~working on a team simulating robots & fulfillment automation at Shopify~~ laid off, building side projects, enjoying some nice weather, and looking for a cool new gig.
- ðŸ§    Iâ€™m currently learning about Golang, Node.js, Typescript, React, Kubernetes, Docker, and more!
- ðŸ“š   Right now I'm reading [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.
