## Greetings and salutations!

- 🛒  I’m currently working on a team simulating robots at 6 River Systems / Shopify
- 🧠  I’m currently learning about React, Node.js, Cypress, ROS, game theory
- 👾  A man of poor taste and internet culture, I enjoy long runs, 4x games, MTG, bad memes, Wikipedia, and music that sounds like nothing.
