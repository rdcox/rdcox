## Greetings and salutations

- ðŸ’¸   Iâ€™m currently working as a full-stack developer at [FloQast](https://floqast.com/) on our authentication and authorization systems
- ðŸ§    Most days Iâ€™m working in Javascript either shipping AWS lambdas, React MFEs, or NPM packages 
- ðŸ“š   Right now I'm reading [Design It!]([http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/](https://pragprog.com/titles/mkdsa/design-it/)) by Michael Keeling

**Disclaimer:** All opinions, bad ideas, and poorly tested code are my own unless otherwise specified. These bear no resemblence to the coherent thoughts of my employer or any organizations I may be affiliated with. They wash their hands of me whenever I'm not around.
